//On listening to this talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDIkqP4JbkE&feature=youtu.be
//and discussing data structures with some communities I decided to revisit this
//
//I overlooked a super elegant and simple solution that executes about 23 times as quickly.


class newSolution
{
    public int Input(int[] input)
    {
        int N = input.Count();
        int counter = 0;

        for(int Q = 0; Q < N; Q++)
        {
            for(int P = 0; P < Q; P++)
            {
                if(input[Q] == input[P])
                {
                    counter++;
                }
            }
        }
        return counter;
    }
}


//I was so eager to implement a hash table...
//I completely overlooked the fact that caching the information was not necessary AT ALL

//Lesson learned.  The time-honored:  "Keep it simple, stupid."
